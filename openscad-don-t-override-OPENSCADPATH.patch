Subject: don't override OPENSCADPATH

the debian tests scripts already set an adaequate OPENSCADPATH; the
overrides in the test scripts would set that wrongly again (because
openscad and mcad are not built in the same tree in debian)

for a cleaner solution, the library path should be respected
unconditionally, removing the necessity for debian to specify a path at
all.
