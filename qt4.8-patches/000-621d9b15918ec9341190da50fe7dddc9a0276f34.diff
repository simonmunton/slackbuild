    Cocoa: QPrintDialog does not show/closes down immediatly
    
    This happends if an event loop recursion ends before
    the native print dialog gets executed (in the same scope).
    
    The reason is that the event dispatcher gets interrupted as the
    first recursion ends. And (because of the big difference between
    how AppKit implements modal windows compared to Qt) this sets a flag
    in the dispatcher that gets handled on the next callback to
    QCocoaEventDispatcher::processPostedEvents. This will tell
    the dispatcher to break out of the current modal session.
    But since it cannot detect that an alien (native) session is now
    running, it closes down that session by accident instead.
    
    While code can be written in the event dispatcher to detect this
    problem, it ends up more clean to just work around the problem
    from the native dialogs instead. This to avoid making the
    dispatcher more complex than it already is. Native dialogs is
    a bit messy already, and the work-arounds needed should be
    isolated inside those components, and not inside the dispatcher.
